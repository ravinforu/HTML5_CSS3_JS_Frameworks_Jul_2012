Implement a simple guessing game in JavaScript. Your code will generate a random number between 1 and 100. The user plays the game till he guesses the number correct. For example, if the number generated is 79, then the user starts playing as shown below.

--> 50
Aim higher
--> 75
Aim higher
--> 90
Aim Lower
--> 80
Aim lower
--> 79
You have got it in 5 attempts

The UI will have a textbox to enter the number and a button. You can display the result in a simple header tag.

Note:
Create a GuessingGame class with the logic in it. Keep the UI and the core logic separate
